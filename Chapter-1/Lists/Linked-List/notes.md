# Linked Lists - The Dynamic Data Structure

Linked lists are a versatile data structure that dynamically adapts to changing data needs. In this chapter, we'll dive into linked lists, covering their structure, advantages, and practical applications.

## Structure of a Linked List

Linked lists are composed of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the list. This structure offers several key benefits

- Dynamic sizing: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

- Efficient insertions and deletions: Manipulating a linked list is often more efficient than the equivalent operations on arrays.

- No need for contiguous memory: Elements are stored at arbitrary locations in memory, providing flexibility in memory allocation.

## Types of Linked Lists

Linked lists come in various flavors, with singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists being the most common types. Each has unique characteristics and use cases.

### Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list, each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Traversal can only be done in one direction, from the head to the tail.

### Doubly Linked List

Doubly linked lists extend singly linked lists by including references to both the next and previous nodes in each node. This bidirectional traversal makes it easier to traverse the list in both directions.

### Circular Linked List

Circular linked lists are variations of singly or doubly linked lists where the last node points back to the first, forming a closed loop.

In this chapter, we've covered the fundamental concepts of lists and explored arrays and linked lists in detail. The knowledge of these data structures is crucial for building efficient algorithms and solving a wide range of computational problems. In the following chapters, we'll continue our journey into the world of lists, including dynamic arrays, algorithms, and more.
