# 1 Finding Sqrt of a number using Binary Search

`Problem Statement`: You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to find and return its square root. If ‘n’ is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of ‘sqrt(n)’.

# 2 Nth Root of a Number using Binary Search

`Problem Statement`: Given two numbers N and M, find the Nth root of M. The nth root of a number M is defined as a number X when raised to the power N equals M. If the ‘nth root is not an integer, return -1.

# 3. Koko Eating Bananas

`Problem Statement`: A monkey is given ‘n’ piles of bananas, whereas the ‘ith’ pile has ‘a[i]’ bananas. An integer ‘h’ is also given, which denotes the time (in hours) for all the bananas to be eaten.

Each hour, the monkey chooses a non-empty pile of bananas and eats ‘k’ bananas. If the pile contains less than ‘k’ bananas, then the monkey consumes all the bananas and won’t eat any more bananas in that hour.

Find the minimum number of bananas ‘k’ to eat per hour so that the monkey can eat all the bananas within ‘h’ hours.

# 4. Minimum days to make M bouquets (✋ **_Marked For Do it Later_**)

`Problem Statement`: You are given ‘N’ roses and you are also given an array ‘arr’ where ‘arr[i]’ denotes that the ‘ith’ rose will bloom on the ‘arr[i]th’ day.
You can only pick already bloomed roses that are adjacent to make a bouquet. You are also told that you require exactly ‘k’ adjacent bloomed roses to make a single bouquet.
Find the minimum number of days required to make at least ‘m’ bouquets each containing ‘k’ roses. Return -1 if it is not possible.

# 5. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold

`Problem Statement`: You are given an array of integers ‘arr’ and an integer i.e. a threshold value ‘limit’. Your task is to find the smallest positive integer divisor, such that upon dividing all the elements of the given array by it, the sum of the division’s result is less than or equal to the given threshold value.

# 6. Capacity to Ship Packages within D Days.

Problem Statement: You are the owner of a Shipment company. You use conveyor belts to ship packages from one port to another. The packages must be shipped within ‘d’ days.
The weights of the packages are given in an array ‘of weights’. The packages are loaded on the conveyor belts every day in the same order as they appear in the array. The loaded weights must not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Find out the least-weight capacity so that you can ship all the packages within ‘d’ days.

# 7. Kth Missing Positive Number

Problem Statement: You are given a strictly increasing array ‘vec’ and a positive integer ‘k’. Find the ‘kth’ positive integer missing from ‘vec’.

# 8. Aggressive Cows : Detailed Solution

Problem Statement: You are given an array ‘arr’ of size ‘n’ which denotes the position of stalls.
You are also given an integer ‘k’ which denotes the number of aggressive cows.
You are given the task of assigning stalls to ‘k’ cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.
Find the maximum possible minimum distance.

# 9. Allocate Minimum Number of Pages

Problem Statement: Given an array ‘arr of integer numbers, ‘ar[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are a ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
Allocate books in such a way that:

Each student gets at least one book.
Each book should be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible. return -1

# 10 . Split Array – Largest Sum

Problem Statement: Given an integer array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ and an integer ‘K’. Split the array ‘A’ into ‘K’ non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized. Your task is to return the minimized largest sum of the split.
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

# 11. Painter’s Partition Problem

Problem Statement: Given an array/list of length ‘N’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘K’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint. You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘N’ boards under the constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

# 12. Minimise Maximum Distance between Gas Stations

Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’, which contains positive integer positions of ‘n’ gas stations on the X-axis. You are also given an integer ‘k’. You have to place ‘k’ new gas stations on the X-axis. You can place them anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, even on non-integer positions. Let ‘dist’ be the maximum value of the distance between adjacent gas stations after adding k new gas stations.
Find the minimum value of ‘dist’.

Note: Answers within 10^-6 of the actual answer will be accepted. For example, if the actual answer is 0.65421678124, it is okay to return 0.654216. Our answer will be accepted if that is the same as the actual answer up to the 6th decimal place.
