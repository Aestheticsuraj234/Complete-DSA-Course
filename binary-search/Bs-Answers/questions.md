# 1 Finding Sqrt of a number using Binary Search

`Problem Statement`: You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to find and return its square root. If ‘n’ is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of ‘sqrt(n)’.

# 2 Nth Root of a Number using Binary Search

`Problem Statement`: Given two numbers N and M, find the Nth root of M. The nth root of a number M is defined as a number X when raised to the power N equals M. If the ‘nth root is not an integer, return -1.

# 3. Koko Eating Bananas

`Problem Statement`: A monkey is given ‘n’ piles of bananas, whereas the ‘ith’ pile has ‘a[i]’ bananas. An integer ‘h’ is also given, which denotes the time (in hours) for all the bananas to be eaten.

Each hour, the monkey chooses a non-empty pile of bananas and eats ‘k’ bananas. If the pile contains less than ‘k’ bananas, then the monkey consumes all the bananas and won’t eat any more bananas in that hour.

Find the minimum number of bananas ‘k’ to eat per hour so that the monkey can eat all the bananas within ‘h’ hours.

# 4. Minimum days to make M bouquets (✋ **_Marked For Do it Later_**)

`Problem Statement`: You are given ‘N’ roses and you are also given an array ‘arr’ where ‘arr[i]’ denotes that the ‘ith’ rose will bloom on the ‘arr[i]th’ day.
You can only pick already bloomed roses that are adjacent to make a bouquet. You are also told that you require exactly ‘k’ adjacent bloomed roses to make a single bouquet.
Find the minimum number of days required to make at least ‘m’ bouquets each containing ‘k’ roses. Return -1 if it is not possible.

# 5. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold

`Problem Statement`: You are given an array of integers ‘arr’ and an integer i.e. a threshold value ‘limit’. Your task is to find the smallest positive integer divisor, such that upon dividing all the elements of the given array by it, the sum of the division’s result is less than or equal to the given threshold value.

# 6. Capacity to Ship Packages within D Days.

Problem Statement: You are the owner of a Shipment company. You use conveyor belts to ship packages from one port to another. The packages must be shipped within ‘d’ days.
The weights of the packages are given in an array ‘of weights’. The packages are loaded on the conveyor belts every day in the same order as they appear in the array. The loaded weights must not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Find out the least-weight capacity so that you can ship all the packages within ‘d’ days.

# 7. Kth Missing Positive Number

Problem Statement: You are given a strictly increasing array ‘vec’ and a positive integer ‘k’. Find the ‘kth’ positive integer missing from ‘vec’.

# 8. Aggressive Cows : Detailed Solution

Problem Statement: You are given an array ‘arr’ of size ‘n’ which denotes the position of stalls.
You are also given an integer ‘k’ which denotes the number of aggressive cows.
You are given the task of assigning stalls to ‘k’ cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.
Find the maximum possible minimum distance.
