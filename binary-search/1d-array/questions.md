# 1 Binary search to find x in sorted array?

# 2 Implement Lower Bound
`Problem Statement`: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

# 3 Implement Lower Bound
`Problem Statement`: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

# 4 Search Insert Position
`Problem Statement`: You are given a sorted array arr of distinct values and a target value x. You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.

# 5 Floor & ceil in Sorted Array;
`Problem Statemen`t: You’re given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in `arr[0..n-1]`.

# 6. First and Last Occurrences in Array
`Problem Statement`: Given a sorted array arr of n integers and a target value k. Write a program to find the indices of the first and the last occurrences of the target value. If the target is not found then return -1 as indices.

# 7. Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array
`Problem Statement`: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

# 8. Search Element in Rotated Sorted Array II
`Problem Statement:` Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicate values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Return True if k is present and otherwise, return False. 


# 9. Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
`Problem Statement: `Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array. 


# 10 Find out how many times the array has been rotated
Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find how many times the array has been rotated. 


# 11. Search Single Element in a sorted array
`Problem Statement`: Given an array of N integers. Every number in the array except one appears twice. Find the single number in the array.


# 12. Peak element in Array
Problem Statement: Given an array of length N. Peak element is defined as the element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if ‘arr[i]’ is the peak element, ‘arr[i – 1]’ < ‘arr[i]’ and ‘arr[i + 1]’ < ‘arr[i]’. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.
