# 1 Binary search to find x in sorted array?

# 2 Implement Lower Bound
`Problem Statement`: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

# 3 Implement Lower Bound
`Problem Statement`: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

# 4 Search Insert Position
`Problem Statement`: You are given a sorted array arr of distinct values and a target value x. You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.

# 5 Floor & ceil in Sorted Array;
`Problem Statemen`t: Youâ€™re given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in `arr[0..n-1]`.

# 6. First and Last Occurrences in Array
`Problem Statement`: Given a sorted array arr of n integers and a target value k. Write a program to find the indices of the first and the last occurrences of the target value. If the target is not found then return -1 as indices.

# 7. Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array
`Problem Statement`: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.
