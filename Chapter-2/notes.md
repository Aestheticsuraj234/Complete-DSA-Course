# Exercise StackðŸ“š

Certainly! Here are the exercises converted into Markdown format:

1. **Exercise 1:** Implement a stack class in TypeScript with the following methods: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, and `size`.

2. **Exercise 2:** Write a TypeScript function to reverse a string using a stack.

3. **Exercise 3:** Implement a stack-based algorithm to check if a string containing parentheses, brackets, and curly braces is balanced.

4. **Exercise 4:** Convert an infix arithmetic expression to postfix notation using a stack. For example, convert "3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5)^2" to "3 4 2 * 1 5 - 2 ^ / +".

5. **Exercise 5:** Implement a stack-based algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for a given number of disks.

6. **Exercise 6:** Write a TypeScript function to simulate a browser's forward and backward navigation using two stacks, one for the back history and one for the forward history.

7. **Exercise 7:** Implement a specialized stack called a "Min Stack" that supports constant-time retrieval of the minimum element in the stack.

8. **Exercise 8:** Use two stacks to implement a queue. Write TypeScript code for the `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.

9. **Exercise 9:** Implement a stack-based algorithm to evaluate a postfix arithmetic expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation).

10. **Exercise 10:** Design and implement a stack-based solution to solve a real-world problem of your choice. For example, you can simulate a simple text editor's undo/redo functionality using two stacks.
