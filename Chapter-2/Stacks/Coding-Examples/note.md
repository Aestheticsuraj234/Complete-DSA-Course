Certainly! Here are 20 questions related to the Stack data structure along with algorithms, concepts, and practical applications. These questions cover a range of difficulty levels and can help you strengthen your understanding of stacks in TypeScript:

1. **Basics of Stacks:**✅✅✅
   - What is a stack? Explain its fundamental principles.
   - Describe the LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of a stack.
   - How is a stack different from an array?

 * // !1. **Basics of Stacks:**
//  !  - What is a stack? Explain its fundamental principles.

// * A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last in firt out ) Pattern. While performing operations on a stack, the last element inserted is the first element to be removed. it inlude various Operations Like push , pop , peek , isEmpty , isFull , size , clear , toArray , toString etc.
// *Its fundamental principles are:
// *1. push(item) - Add an item to the top of the stack.
// *2.  pop() - Remove item from the top of the stack.
// *3. peek() - Return the top element  of the stack.
// *4. isEmpty() - Return true if and only if the stack is empty.

//   ! - Describe the LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of a stack.

// * The LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of a stack means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

//    !- How is a stack different from an array?

// * A stack is different from an array in the following ways:
// *1. A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, whereas an array is a linear data structure.
// *2. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top, whereas in an array, elements are added and removed from arbitrary positions.
// *3. In a stack, the size is fixed, whereas in an array, the size is dynamic.
// *4. In a stack, the operations are push and pop, whereas in an array, the operations are insert, delete, and random access.
// *5. In a stack, the operations are O(1), whereas in an array, the operations are O(n).

2. **Implementations:**
   - Implement a stack using an array in TypeScript.
   - Implement a stack using a linked list in TypeScript.

3. **Operations on Stacks:**
   - Explain the push and pop operations on a stack.
   - Write a TypeScript function to check if parentheses in an expression are balanced using a stack.

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - Implement a TypeScript function to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression using a stack.
   - Write a TypeScript function to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack.

5. **Function Call Stack:**
   - Explain how the function call stack works.
   - Demonstrate the concept of recursion using the function call stack.

6. **Applications:**
   - Describe a real-world scenario where a stack can be used effectively.
   - Implement a browser history using a stack.

7. **Next Greater Element:**
   - Given an array, implement a TypeScript function to find the next greater element for each element in the array using a stack.

8. **Min Stack:**
   - Implement a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

9. **Sorting a Stack:**
   - Implement a TypeScript function to sort a stack.

10. **Balanced Parentheses:**
    - Write a TypeScript function to check if a given string of parentheses is balanced using a stack.

11. **Stock Span Problem:**
    - Given an array representing stock prices on different days, implement a TypeScript function to calculate the span of stock's price for all days.

12. **Tower of Hanoi:**
    - Explain the Tower of Hanoi problem and how it can be solved using recursion and a stack.

13. **Infix to Prefix Conversion:**
    - Implement a TypeScript function to convert an infix expression to a prefix expression using a stack.

14. **Postfix Expression Evaluation:**
    - Write a TypeScript function to evaluate a postfix expression that contains multiple-digit numbers.

15. **Expression Tree:**
    - Explain how an expression tree can be constructed from a postfix expression.

16. **Special Stack:**
    - Implement a stack that supports push, pop, getMinimum (retrieving the minimum element), and getAverage (retrieving the average element) in constant time.

17. **Celebrity Problem:**
    - Given a matrix representing people and their known relationships, implement a TypeScript function to find a celebrity if one exists.

18. **Queue Using Stacks:**
    - Implement a queue using two stacks.

19. **Decode String:**
    - Given an encoded string, implement a TypeScript function to decode it using a stack.

20. **Implement a Browser Back Button:**
    - Simulate the behavior of a browser's back button using a stack to keep track of visited pages.
