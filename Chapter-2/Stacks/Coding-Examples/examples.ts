// !1. **Basics of Stacks:**
//  !  - What is a stack? Explain its fundamental principles.

// * A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last in firt out ) Pattern. While performing operations on a stack, the last element inserted is the first element to be removed. it inlude various Operations Like push , pop , peek , isEmpty , isFull , size , clear , toArray , toString etc.
// *Its fundamental principles are:
// *1. push(item) - Add an item to the top of the stack.
// *2.  pop() - Remove item from the top of the stack.
// *3. peek() - Return the top element  of the stack.
// *4. isEmpty() - Return true if and only if the stack is empty.

//   ! - Describe the LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of a stack.

// * The LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of a stack means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

//    !- How is a stack different from an array?

// * A stack is different from an array in the following ways:
// *1. A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, whereas an array is a linear data structure.
// *2. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top, whereas in an array, elements are added and removed from arbitrary positions.
// *3. In a stack, the size is fixed, whereas in an array, the size is dynamic.
// *4. In a stack, the operations are push and pop, whereas in an array, the operations are insert, delete, and random access.
// *5. In a stack, the operations are O(1), whereas in an array, the operations are O(n).
